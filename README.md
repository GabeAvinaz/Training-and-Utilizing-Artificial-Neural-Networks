# Training and Utilizing Artificial Neural Networks

An Example of training and implementing ANNs for image and text classification.

## Project Overview

This project uses a variety of Keras datasets to demonstrate the building of a convolution neural network.  The project also shows examples of built-in models within the Keras module to categorize a set of images.

## Features

-Using MNIST dataset, a CNN is designed to serve as a model for handwriting recognition.  
-With the CIFAR10 dataset, these concepts are expanded upon and implemented on a more difficult dataset.
-The last section of this project explores the ResNet50 implementation of a neural network.  The prebuilt model is loaded from Keras and used to predict relevant categories for a random assortment of images.

## Installation

The application is contained in an Interactive Python Notebook and requires the installation of the latest version of Python along with TensorFlow and all relevant dependencies.

## Usage

1. Project can be run using any Jupyter Notebook-compatible application.
2. Make sure to run each block of code in order to gain successful results.

## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. Currently, I’m not accepting external contributions. This project is intended for demonstrational purposes only.
